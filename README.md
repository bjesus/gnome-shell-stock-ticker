To install:
* Make the build script executable (`chmod +x build`)
* `./build`

This script just copies the files to the correct place (SVG files go to ~/.local/share/icons and the rest go in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/stock-ticker@akmiller.co.uk/)

It is possible to add new companies by entering the stock code in the text box on the menu or multiple companies separated by a comma.
